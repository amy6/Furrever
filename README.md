# Furrever

Furrever uses the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to display a list of cute dog photos. 🐶 The app is built (and continues to be built) to demonstrate the features of the Jetpack [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) library such as the below:

* One-time and Periodic tasks
* Setting constraints to a task
* Handling data with Workers
* Observing work status with LiveData
* And more coming soon...
